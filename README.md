#Dispersion Trading Strategy 

Dispersion Trading strategy in BankNifty and Its Constituents
Project Description
This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook and supporting Python code that illustrate a dispersion trading strategy applied to the BankNifty index and its constituents. The strategy utilizes statistical measures to exploit discrepancies in the implied volatilities between an index and its components, aiming for profitable trading opportunities.

Features
Calculation of Implied Volatility: Using the mibian library, the project demonstrates how to calculate the implied volatility for both the BankNifty index and its constituent stocks.
Analysis of Dirty Implied Correlation: It includes a methodology to compute and analyze the dirty implied correlation, providing insights into the volatility relationship between the index and its constituents.
Trading Signal Generation: The implementation includes logic to generate trading signals based on deviations from the mean correlation, helping identify optimal moments for trade execution.
Performance Evaluation: The notebook evaluates the profitability of the dispersion trading strategy through historical data, illustrating potential returns and risks.
Interactive Analysis: Interactive Python code allows users to experiment with different parameters and visualize their impact on strategy outcomes.
